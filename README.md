# Amazon Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook `AMZNStockPrediction.ipynb` demonstrating the process of predicting Amazon's stock prices using Rolling Ordinary Least Squares (RollingOLS) model.

## Project Structure
- Data Importing and Visualizing: The data is imported, cleaned, and visualized to understand the trends in Amazon's stock prices over time.
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into a training set (2010-2015) and a testing set (2016).
- Model Building: A RollingOLS model is trained.
- Performance Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set. RMSE is used as the performance metric.
- Conclusion: Final remarks and directions for future work.

## Usage
- Clone this repository
- Unzip the `prices-split-adjusted.zip` file
- Open the AMZNStockPrediction.ipynb notebook
- Run the notebook cells

## Note
This project serves as a demonstration of time series prediction and is not intended to be used for making actual investment decisions.
